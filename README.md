# Powershell

Do you use Windows?
Are you a poser?
Do you need a poser shell?
Well have I got a PS1 for you


To install: 
PS> Set-executionPolicy unrestricted

\# move to where you extracted it to...

PS> .\install.ps1

\# it will execute and install the profile to your PShome folder.....

\# it's now a good idea to set the execution policy back to signed, the default for Windows 8+

PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy signed

\# and there you go, knock yourself out.
